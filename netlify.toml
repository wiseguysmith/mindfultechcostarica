# Netlify Configuration for MindfulTech
# 
# As your CTO mentor, I'm showing you how to configure Netlify for Next.js deployment.
# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs automatically handles routing, so we don't need manual redirects.

[build]
  command = "npm run build"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

# Environment variables can be set in Netlify dashboard
# For example:
# [build.environment]
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = "https://mindfultech.services"
