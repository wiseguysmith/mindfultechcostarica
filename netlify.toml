# Netlify Configuration for MindfulTech
# 
# As your CTO mentor, I'm showing you how to configure Netlify for Next.js deployment.
# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs automatically handles routing, so we don't need manual redirects.
#
# IMPORTANT: If Netlify's base directory is set to the repository root,
# use the netlify.toml in the root directory instead.

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  base = "."

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

# Temporarily disabled to fix build
# [[plugins]]
#   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

# Environment variables can be set in Netlify dashboard
# For example:
# [build.environment]
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL = "https://mindfultech.services"
